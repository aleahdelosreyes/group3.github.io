      <article>
        <p>     For us to find the need of a viewer, the first thing we did was identify what streaming means and how it works. Then, we were able to find some information about streaming which means that streaming is the usage of media by watching and listening such as video and audio where it can be recorded or live. Watching a live stream is more efficient since you don’t need to download the files anymore while a recorded stream requires you to download the stream since it was already recorded and it takes time.</p>
        <p>     Next, we find what kind of content catches their attention and so in this part, we also did a thorough research and we were able to find some information on internet and we’re also able to do a survey virtually by using google form and we surveyed out that they mostly watch gaming content such us CODM, ML, GROWTOPIA, etc.</p>

Based on our research, people are watching streams because they are experiencing stress from our current situation. They also watch streams because they want to socialize with other people to make new friends.</p>

      <h2>Characteristics of a Good Streamer</h2>
      <article>
        <p> 1.) The Behaviour of the Streamer - This is the first and largest topic since I believe it is the most crucial in determining whether or not I will remain with a stream. I put streamer ahead of material since a consistent streamer is far more dependable than relying on specific stream content. Streamers come to mind as coworkers or classmates. Would I feel comfortable interacting with you if we were in the same area and had to do so frequently? When determining this, I take into account a few criteria.</p>
        <p> 2.) Consistency - This is a large one that covers a lot of ground when it comes to streaming. When it comes to consistency, I examine the frequency of streaming, the flow of stream content, as well as mood and conduct. It's tough to keep interested in a stream when the start times are unpredictable, the streamer regularly starts content and walks on before finishing it, or the streamer appears to be a new person each time. I've found that having a game or a specific piece of content act as the backbone for someone's broadcast is the most effective way to maintain consistency. It's conceivable to bounce back and forth between diversity and consistency from there, especially if fresh strides are made.</p>

        <p>    3.) Layout and Balance of the Stream - The aesthetics and sound quality of someone's stream are crucial, perhaps even more so for some than for others. When it comes to widescreen 16:9 games, I prefer full-screen games with no extra fluff. If the streamer has a webcam, there's almost always a good small place to tuck it into, and it just makes viewing more comfortable when there aren't any noisy boundaries distracting from the game. Frames and layouts don't deter me from watching a video unless they divert my attention away from the actual content.</p>
